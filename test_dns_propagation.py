To verify SendGrid Inbound Parse is set up correctly:

1. Go to SendGrid Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Inbound Parse
2. Look for a webhook configured for 'itsbennie.com'
3. Verify the destination URL is correct:
   https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/sendgrid-inbound?secret=YOUR_SECRET

4. Make sure these options are checked:
   ‚úÖ POST the raw, full MIME message
   ‚úÖ Send Raw (recommended)

5. Check the SendGrid Activity Feed:
   - Go to SendGrid Dashboard ‚Üí Activity
   - Look for "Inbound Parse" events
   - Send a test email to Bennie@itsbennie.com
   - You should see an inbound parse event if it's working

If you don't see inbound parse events, the issue might be:
- SendGrid Inbound Parse webhook not configured
- Wrong webhook URL
- DNS still propagating
- Email being sent to wrong address

To test if emails are reaching SendGrid:

1. Send a test email to Bennie@itsbennie.com from an external email address
   (NOT from an @itsbennie.com address)

2. Check SendGrid Activity Feed:
   - Go to SendGrid Dashboard ‚Üí Activity
   - Look for the email in the activity feed
   - If you see it, SendGrid is receiving emails
   - If you don't see it, emails are still going elsewhere

3. Check your Railway logs:
   - Look for webhook POST requests to /api/sendgrid-inbound
   - If you see them, the webhook is working
   - If not, SendGrid isn't calling your webhook

4. Check your database:
   - Look in the email_history table for new entries
   - If you see entries, everything is working!

Common issues:
- DNS propagation delay (can take 24-48 hours)
- Email client caching old DNS results
- SendGrid Inbound Parse not configured
- Wrong webhook URL in SendGrid
