-- Verification script for auth migration
-- Run each section and verify the results

-- 1. Check table structure
SELECT 
    column_name, 
    data_type, 
    is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
    AND table_name = 'users'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 2. Check foreign key constraints
SELECT
    tc.table_schema, 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_schema AS foreign_table_schema,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
    AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
    AND tc.table_schema = 'public';

-- 3. Check RLS policies
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- 4. Check triggers
SELECT 
    event_object_schema as table_schema,
    event_object_table as table_name,
    trigger_schema,
    trigger_name,
    string_agg(event_manipulation, ',') as event,
    action_timing as activation,
    action_statement as definition
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_schema = 'public'
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,6,7
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
